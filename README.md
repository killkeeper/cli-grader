CLI Grader
==========
Being a TA can be challenging and onerous. Amongst all TA tasks, the one I
hated the most involves entering the grades into the Blackboard system. 

This set of Python scripts was created to enter students' grades in a more 
humane and less excruciating way (at least for me), in a terminal supporting
ncurses.

Grades are entered on a per-question basis so that summary plots can be 
subsequently generated for visualization.
To report grades/scores to Blackboard, the user can download the course grade
sheet from Blackboard in CSV format, use the provided merging script to
automatically fill in the grades, then upload the merged grade sheet to
Blackboard.

Many long, or even sleepless nights witnessed my painstaking experience of
being a grader in STAT 330, as well as the development of this project.

Currently this project is not actively under-development, but I may revive it
someday if I were assigned as a grader for some course in the future.
